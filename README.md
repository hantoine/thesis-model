# Thesis model

Source code of the neural network I developed during my Master's thesis on the evaluation of the predictive power of telemetric driving data for the estimation of the road accident risk.

This repository is not the repository I used during my thesis, it only contains the source of the model and does not include the data wrangling code.
The original repository cannot be published because it might contain metadata or statistics of the dataset used. The dataset cannot be shared because it contains personally identifiable information.

The model is defined in [`model.py`](model.py).
